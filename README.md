# C-Data-Structures-Bot-War

According to the FBI, cybernetic attacks through bot networks have greatly proliferated to the extent that it can provoke severe complications in all kinds of sectors. To detect these kinds of situations, we can collect all pertinent information to allow us to make optimized searches for the opportune detection of malignant access attempts. 

In this project, we addressed the following questions:
1) Which data structures are the best to store this kind of information?
2) What data structure will enable us to make a more efficient information search?
3) How can we know if it is a malignant access?
4) How can we distinguish real access attempts from those which aren't?
5) How can we implement groups of information that characterize these accesses?
